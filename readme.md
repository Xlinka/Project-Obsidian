# Project Obsidian

Project Obsidian is a Resonite plugin that introduces new components, Protoflux nodes and features. It serves as an experimental space for testing concepts and expanding the boundaries of the virtual reality platform. The primary goal of Project Obsidian is to realize ideas that the base game does not yet feature.

Key features and benefits of Project Obsidian include:

- Incorporating community-driven ideas from both the Project Obsidian Discord and the main Resonite GitHub repository.
- Trialing new concepts and functionalities that could elevate the Resonite experience.
- Regularly engaging with users to accumulate feedback and suggestions, ensuring the plugin remains at the forefront of user needs.

## Project Obsidian Plugin Installation

**Important:** Project Obsidian is a plugin, not a mod. Ensure you follow the correct installation steps.

1. Download the zip file from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Xlinka/Project-Obsidian/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded files to the `Libraries` folder in your Resonite directory.
3. Add the `-LoadAssembly` launch argument followed by the plugin's file path: `-LoadAssembly Libraries/Project-Obsidian.dll`.

Upon doing this, start Resonite. Navigate to the Obsidian category in your dash settings and ensure the Plugin Loaded setting is True. For further details, refer to your logs.

For a comprehensive guide, please refer to our [installation wiki](https://github.com/Xlinka/Project-Obsidian/wiki/Installation).

## Project Obsidian プラグインのインストール

**重要:** Project Obsidian はModではなくプラグインです。正しい手順に従ってインストールしてください。

1. [Releasesタブ](https://github.com/Xlinka/Project-Obsidian/releases)からzipファイルをダウンロードします。

## Project Obsidian 플러그인 설치

**중요:** Project Obsidian은 모드가 아닌 플러그인입니다. 올바른 설치 절차를 반드시 따라주세요.

1. [Releases 탭](https://github.com/Xlinka/Project-Obsidian/releases)에서 zip 파일을 다운로드합니다.  
2. 다운로드한 파일을 Resonite 디렉토리 내 `Libraries` 폴더에 압축 해제합니다.  
3. 실행 시 `-LoadAssembly` 실행 인자와 함께 플러그인의 파일 경로를 추가합니다: `-LoadAssembly Libraries/Project-Obsidian.dll`

이 작업을 완료한 후 Resonite를 시작하세요. 대시 설정에서 Obsidian 카테고리로 이동하여 *Plugin Loaded* 설정이 True로 되어 있는지 확인하세요. 자세한 내용은 로그 파일을 참조하세요.
